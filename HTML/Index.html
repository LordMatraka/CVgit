            <h3>Personal intro:</h3>
            <p>Just a normal citizen, with a social
                security number. That's me. I'm trustworthy, but not exactly
                legal.
                One day my computer started to behave weird and a message popped
                up on my screen. Knock, Knock, Neo. Then all got even weirder.
                Now the Matrix has me.</p>

            <h3>Latest Professional Exp:</h3>
            <p>I held a job for quite a while
                on Metecortex, a software company, as a programmer. That was,
                during the day.
                During the night, I was a hacker called Neo, using my quite
                great habilities so sell (software) contraband. I'm currently
                part of the Nebuchadnezzar crew.</p>
